# Blog Upgrade Todo List

## GitHub Pages Compatible Upgrade (Current Branch)

### High Priority
- [ ] **Upgrade to Ruby 3.3.4** (GitHub Pages compatible)
- [ ] **Upgrade Jekyll to ~3.10.0** (GitHub Pages compatible)  
- [ ] **Update Gemfile** with GitHub Pages compatible versions

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Test local build** with new versions
- [ ] **Verify site still works** after changes
- [ ] Add circle CI workflow to test build, and also possibly a first pass at a 'link checker' workflow (i imagine this will fail, but it's a start)

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Update CLAUDE.md** with new Ruby/Jekyll versions
